Greetings tatson,

I hesitate to write this email. Please take your time considering this information.

Our last email covered how focusing on being a better ‘me’ got me out of bad debt. Here’s how that worked…

Hopefully you’ve already read, Freedom From Bad Debt.

In that book I explain how Kim and I got out of bad debt. While the mechanics are solid, many of you noticed the addition of a paragraph in the book that says;

Q: Do you have to be debt-free before you invest?
A: No. This is your choice. We had quite a bit of debt when we started investing…

Many people contacted us dumbfounded. How could you be investing while still in so much debt?!?

The answer is educated investing. By focusing on bettering myself instead of solely focusing on getting out of bad debt I was able to see through the chaos and find the options that worked for me.

Even while struggling with debt I listened to rich dad when he explained to me that I needed to focus on myself first. Even while drowning in debt I paid to attend a seminar that taught me how to profit from real estate.

I spent money on myself while still being completely underwater. That class changed my life. I learned how to find good returns on real estate deals that required little money down and produced a lot of income. The income from these deals I eliminated all my bad debt!

It’s a bold step, but ask yourself what you could accomplish if you invested in yourself WHILE getting yourself out of bad debt.

To making life better,
